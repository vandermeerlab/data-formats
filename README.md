Playing around with different data formats and loaders

# Organization

- `data/` is a DataLad subdataset (git submodule) from
  http://datasets.datalad.org/?dir=/labs/mvdm . All the notebooks then 
  could just use relative paths pointing to subdatasets underneath.
  DataLad could be used either from command line or straight via Python
  interface, learn more from http://handbook.datalad.org/
